## Usage

### Creating a Draft

1. Visit the home page
2. Upload your cube CSV file (you can create one at [YGOProdeck Cube Builder](https://ygoprodeck.com/cube/))
3. Configure your draft settings:
   - Select a draft method (Winston, Rochester or Grid)
   - Set the number of players
   - Configure additional settings based on the draft method
4. Start the draft and share the URL with other players

### Participating in a Draft

1. Open the shared draft URL
2. Wait for all players to join
3. The draft creator will start the draft when everyone is ready
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to draft cards based on the selected method

## Draft Methods

### Winston Draft

In Winston Draft, cards are arranged into piles. On your turn:
1. Look at the first pile
2. Choose to either take that pile or pass to the next pile
3. If you pass on all piles, you must take a card from the top of the pool deck
4. After your selection, add a card from the deck to each pile you passed

### Rochester Draft

In Rochester Draft:
1. Cards are laid out face up in "packs"
2. Players take turns selecting one card at a time from the available pack
3. The direction of picking reverses each round
4. When a pack is empty, a new one is opened

### Grid Draft

In Grid Draft:
1. Cards are arranged face up in a grid (Default is 3Ã—3)
2. Players take turns to select a row/column of the grid, adding those cards to their drafted deck
3. Replenish rows/columns with new cards from the pool
4. Continue until each player has desired number of cards

### Asynchronous Draft

In Asynchronous Draft:
1. Players draft independently at their own pace without needing to coordinate schedules
2. Each player opens their own packs and selects cards
3. Once a card is drafted by a player, it's no longer available to others (unless you enable `Allow overlap in player packs`)
4. Players can join and make picks whenever they have time
5. Draft continues until all players have completed their selections

## Changelog

- [19/05/2025] I have disabled sign in with OAuth for now as there is no advantage to doing this compared to signing in anonymously. I want to avoid storing any user data until it becomes necessary to do that for some functionality (e.g. saving your own cubes). If you previously signed in with your Discord/GitHub account, your data has been deleted from Supabase.
